# Team-Project-Part1-2
This is a piece of group coursework from Year 2 at Loughborough university. 
We were given a "client" (our lecturers) to work and liase with to produce a working website based on the product they wanted. At the end of each part there was a demonstration to show off the product at it's current stage.
This module taught us how to use google cloud platform, linux, and how to work in a (mock) real world scenario.
